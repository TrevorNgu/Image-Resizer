#Image Resizer

Resize all inputted images to share the same dimensions. Should be used before the QDED code to make all files be uniformed.

How to use:
1. Put images you want to convert into the "to_convert" folder. If folders don't exist, create them in the same directory as main.
2. Run make command to generate executable
3. Run executable

You can adjust the dimension sizes in the constant.h folder.
